    * `payment_initiated`: Tracks when a user lands on the Payment Gateway page.
    * `payment_completed`: Tracks successful completion of the simulated payment form.
    * `volunteer_signup`: Tracks successful submissions of the Volunteer Signup form.
* **Scroll Tracking**:
    * `scroll_depth`: Tracks scroll progress on the long "Awareness" page at **25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%** depth.
